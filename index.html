            <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action role-playing video game that takes place in the 31st century,
                in a post-apocalyptic world where colossal machines dominate the land. Human civilization has
                regressed to tribal societies of hunters and gatherers who survive in immense forests, imposing mountain
                ranges, and the atmospheric ruins of their ancestors â€“ all while the machines become increasingly
                powerful. The player controls Aloy, a huntress who uses her speed, cunning, and agility to stay alive
                and protect herself and others against the force, size, and power of the machines.</p>

            <h2>Aloy's Shrine</h2>
            <p>Aloy is the main protagonist of Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, and a minor character in
                Horizon Call of the Mountain. A Nora Brave, Seeker and machine hunter of unparalleled skill, Aloy is the
                genetic clone of 21st century roboticist and engineer Dr. Elisabet Sobeck.
                <br> <br>

                We admire Aloy and consider her a feminist
                role model due to her strong and independent personality, resourcefulness, and determination to
                challenge gender norms in her post-apocalyptic world. As a skilled hunter, warrior, and strategist, Aloy
                defies traditional gender roles and expectations, displaying courage and resilience in the face of
                adversity. She also fights against oppressive forces and seeks truth and justice, advocating for gender
                equality and challenging social injustices. Aloy's character embodies qualities often associated with
                feminism, such as empowerment, agency, and a commitment to equality, making her a beloved and
                inspirational figure for players who appreciate strong female characters in video games.

                "The strength to stand alone is the strength to make a stand. To serve a purpose greater than
                yourself. That is the lesson you must learn." -Aloy

            <h2>Ted Faro Haters</h2>
            <p>Ted Faro is is depicted as the founder and former CEO of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), a company that
                played a pivotal role in the backstory of the game's post-apocalyptic world.
                <br><br>
                There are many reasons why we have feelings of animosity for Ted Faro, of which:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Causing the Apocalypse: In the game's lore, Ted Faro was responsible for the creation of an advanced
                    artificial intelligence system known as GAIA, which was designed to counteract the environmental
                    crisis that had devastated the world. However, he made the disastrous decision to add a
                    self-destruct function to GAIA, leading to the complete destruction of the project and triggering a
                    global catastrophe known as the "Faro Plague." This resulted in the near-extinction of humanity and
                    the rise of robotic creatures that threaten human survival.</li>
                <li>Destroying Evidence: After the catastrophic failure of GAIA, Ted Faro tried to cover up his mistake
                    by systematically destroying all evidence related to GAIA and its subordinate functions, including
                    the killing of the Alphas, the team of scientists who were working on the project. This action
                    prevented anyone from understanding or repairing the damage he caused, further exacerbating the dire
                    situation of the post-apocalyptic world.</li>
                <li>
                    Lack of Accountability: Ted Faro's actions in the game's lore depict him as a character who is
                    unwilling to take responsibility for his mistakes. Instead of facing the consequences of his
                    actions, he chose to erase any evidence of his involvement and went into hiding, leaving humanity to
                    suffer the consequences of his disastrous decisions.
                </li>
                <li>Betrayal of Trust: Ted Faro's actions can be seen as a betrayal of the trust that was placed in him
                    as the CEO of a major corporation. He was entrusted with the responsibility of developing solutions
                    to save humanity from an impending environmental crisis, but his reckless decisions and lack of
                    accountability resulted in catastrophic consequences that changed the course of human history.</li>
